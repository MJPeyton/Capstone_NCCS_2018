	<h1>A Visual Tour of The Urban Institute's 2018 Nonprofit Brief</h1>
	<p>
		Every year the Urban Institute’s National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS) collects, cleans, and shares data for researchers and policy makers in order to make better, data-informed decisions. As a part of that annual production, they release a <a href="https://nccs.urban.org/publication/nonprofit-sector-brief-2018" target="_blank">year in brief report</a>.
	<p>	
		My goal is to make that brief more engaging by presenting the data in a visual format while also providing more context. My hope is that a broader range of readers will be better able to absorb and internalize the information.

		<h2>The Nonprofit Universe</h2>
			<article>
				<p>As of 2015, there were 1.56 million nonprofits in the United States. To give you some idea of what that means, in 2017 there were 647,288 restaurants in the United States. </p>

				<h5>Nonprofits Registered with the IRS</h5>
				<div class = "vis" id="one"></div>

				<div class="citation">Sources: <a href="https://nccs.urban.org/publication/nonprofit-sector-brief-2018">Urban Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2018/total-us-restaurant-count-at-647288-a-drop-from-last-year-due-to-decline-in-independent-restaurant-units-reports-npd/"> NPD Group</a></div>

				<p>That means for every restaurant you see (every diner, McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Italian restaurant, seafood shack, 5 star restarant, etc.), there are between two and three nonprofits registered in the United States.</p>

				<div class="explain">
						<h4>Why Are These Nonprofit Numbers From 2015? </h4>
						
						<p>The reason the latest numbers available are from 2015 is due to a lag between when financial documents are required to be submitted and when they are available, cleaned, and made available by the NCCS. </p>
						</div>	
				
				<h4>Nonprofit Growth</h4>

				<p>That number of registered nonprofits has grown roughly 15% since 2005, and 7% since 2010.</p>

				<p>However, it's important to note that the term nonprofit can actually refer to a broad range of organizations and not all nonprofits are the same.</p>

				<h3>Nonprofits vs Public Charities</h3>
				
				<p>When we say nonprofit, we are really talking about an umbrella term for a lot of different types of organizations.</p>

				<div class="quote"><p>"People often use the words 'nonprofit' and 'tax exempt' interchangeably. Congress has created almost three dozen types of tax-exempt organizations in different sections of the tax code. These include 
					<ul>
					<li>Section 501(c)(4) (social welfare organizations, homeowners associations, and volunteer fire companies), </li>
					<li>Section 501(c)(5) (includes labor unions), </li>
					<li>Section 501(c)(6) (includes chambers of commerce), and </li>
					<li>Section 501(k) (child care organizations). </li>
				</ul>
				"Each section identifies certain conditions that must be met to be exempt from paying federal income taxes. The one common condition is not paying out profits ('no part of the organization’s net earnings can inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual'); hence the term, 'nonprofit.' </p>
				<p>
				"Section 501(c)(3) of the tax code refers to 'public charities' (also known as charitable nonprofits) and 'private foundations.' </p>
				
				<p>"The tax code considers 'churches and religious organizations' (which the IRS defines to include mosques, synagogues, temples, and other houses of worship) to be 'public charities.'"</p>
				
				<div class="citation_text">Source: <a href="https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/what-is-a-nonprofit">Council of Nonprofits</a></div></div>

				<p>When people use the term "Nonprofit" vernacularly, they are often refereing to public charities.

				<p>For example, the following are public charities:
				<ul>
					<li>The United Way</li>
					<li>Habitat for Humanity</li>
					<li>The YMCA</li>
					<li>St. Jude Children's Research Hospital</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Conversely, the following are nonprofits, but not public charities:
				<ul>
					<li>Teacher retirement funds</li>
					<li>Cemetary companies</li>
					<li>Social and recreation clubs</li>
					<li>Chambers of commerce</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="citation_text">Source: <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=1559">Charity Navigator</a></div>

				<p>For the rest of this discussion, we are going to focus on public charities, but not <i>all</i> public charities.</p>

				<p>You see, not all public charities are required to submit the same documentation to the government. We only have access to the finances from public charities that were required to file a Form 990, Form 990-EZ or Form 990-PF.
	
				<div class="explain">

				<h4>Who has to file a Form 990?</h4>

				<h4 style="font-size: 1rem;">Before tax year 2010</h4>
				<ul>
				<li>Nonprofits with gross receipts of $25,000 or more (excluding religious congregations)
				<li>All private foundations, regardless of size
				</ul>
				<h4 style="font-size: 1rem;">Beginning in 2010</h4>
				<ul>
				<li>Only organizations with $50,000 or more in gross receipts (excluding religious congregations) 
				<li>All private foundations, regardless of size
				</ul>
				<p>Note: Organizations with less than $50,000 in gross receipts are required to file an information return known as the Form 990-N (e-Postcard).

				<p>So for the rest of the deep dive, we're looking at <i>reporting</i> public charities.

				<h3>Public Charities by Type</h3>
				
				<p>As you might expect, there is a great amount of diversity in the types of public charities. Below is a breakdown of the number of reporting public charities in 2015 by type of work they perform.</p>
				
				<h5>Reporting Public Charities by Type</h5>
				<div class = "vis" id="five"></div>

				<div class="citation">Source: <a href="https://nccs.urban.org/publication/nonprofit-sector-brief-2018">Urban Institute</a></div>

				<p>Between 2005 and 2015 there has been a large shift in the number of reporting public charities by type. For instance, there was almost 18% growith in the number of international organizations over that 10 year period, while there was an almost 10% decreaese in the number of arts organizations.</p>

			<h2>Finances</h2>
				<article>
						
					<p>Over that same 10 year period from 2005 to 2015, the revenue and assets of reporting public charities have increased. However, not all types of public charities have seen the same types of growth.</p>
					
					<h5>Change in Revenue from 2005 to 2015 by Type</h5>

				</article>
				<article>

					<p>Due to the nature of nonprofits, the revenue and expendatures of each type of organization are very closely related. However, the amount of assets that is reported by each type of organization isn't always as corrleated.</p>

					<p>For instance, in 2015 both Higher Education and Human Services had around $230 billion dollars in revenue. However, in that same year, Higher Education organizations held $736 billion in assets while Human Services organizations only held $357 billion.
					
					<h5>Assets of Reporting Public Charities by Type</h5>

		<h2>Further Research</h2>
			<article>
			<p>While the NCCS statistics do a great job of cleaning, combining, and summarizing the state of public charity finances, the IRS is also a great resource for quickly finding the tax documents of specific nonprofits.</p>

			<p>If you are interested in finding the Form 990 for a specific nonprofit, enter the organization name in the form below to see if the IRS has a copy of their recent forms on file.
